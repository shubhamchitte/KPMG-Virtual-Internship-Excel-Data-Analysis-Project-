## Introduction

Sprocket Central Pty Ltd, a mid-sized company specializing in bikes and cycling accessories, has engaged Tony Smith, a Partner within KPMG's Lighthouse & Innovation Team. Sprocket Central is eager to explore KPMG's capabilities in analytics, information, and modeling through their dedicated team. The project is structured around three primary tasks:

## Task 1: Data Quality Assessment
#### Assessment of data quality and completeness in preparation for analysis

The client furnished KPMG with three datasets:

* Customer Demographic 
* Customer Addresses
* Transactions data in the past 3 months

The Exploratory Data Analysis was performed to identify ways to improve the quality of Sprocket Central Pty Ltdâ€™s data.

## Task 2: Data Insights
#### Targeting high value customers based on customer demographics and attributes.

* The recommendation was initiated through a PowerPoint presentation that delineated the planned approach.
* The client has approved a three-week scope structured around three phases: Data Exploration, Model Development, and Interpretation.
* An elaborate approach was devised for executing the analysis, encompassing tasks such as comprehending data distributions, conducting feature engineering, implementing data transformations, modeling, interpreting results, and compiling reports.

## Task 3: Data Insights and Presentation
#### Using visualisations to present insights

A dashboard was crafted to exhibit the analysis results and a succinct summary of the data. Key focal points during the presentation of findings included:

* Unveiling trends inherent in the data.
* Identifying the customer segment exhibiting the highest customer value.
* Formulating recommendations for the marketing and growth strategy of Sprocket Central Pty Ltd.
* Suggesting potential external datasets that could provide deeper insights into customer preferences and their likelihood to purchase the products.
